/* This is a compact, 100% standalone reference XXH32 streaming implementation.
 * Instead of focusing on performance hacks, this focuses on cleanliness,
 * conformance, portability and simplicity.
 *
 * This file aims to be 100% compatible with C90/C++98, with the additional
 * requirement of stdint.h. Unlike the single-run implementation, this uses
 * malloc, free, memset, and memcpy. */
